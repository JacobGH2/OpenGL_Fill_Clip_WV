# OpenGL Clipping, Filling, and Viewport Transformation

Menu options are available through right-clicking (available at all times):
1. Clipping - clip the world polygon (when visible) against the dashed clipping window
2. Fill - fill the polygon

The color of the square in the top right corner indicates the current mode:
1. Red: Polygon Drawing - click to select vertices of a new polygon, press ```c``` to complete the polygon (functions will not work without this step)
2. Green: Clipping - Draw the clipping window
3. Blue: Viewport - Draw the viewport window (transformed polygon will scale automatically)

Additional key commands:
1. f - close the program
2. w, a, s, d - panning (when VT polygon visible)
3. v - toggle whether world polygon or viewport polygon is visible
4. i, o - zoom in and out of the viewport polygon, respectively
5. r - switch modes
